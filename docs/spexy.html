<h1>Language Reference</h1>

<p><a href="index.html">Spexy</a> is a Lisp dialect for expressing
Python.</p>



<h2>Expressions</h2>

<p>An expressions in Spexy can be a token, a quoted string, a special
form, or a list of expressions. Tokens are evaluated to bound
variables, or members of bound variables using dotted notation. List
members are evaluated in order of appearance, and the first member is
called as a function with the remaining members as arguments.</p>

<p>Some examples of Spexy expressions:

<ol>

<li><code>&quot;foo&quot;</code> a literal string</li>

<li><code>105</code> a literal number</li>

<li><code>foo</code> the variable foo</li>

<li><code>foo.bar</code> the bar member of the variable foo</li>

<li><code>(foo.bar 5)</code> calling the bar member of the variable
foo as a function, with the argument 5</li>

</ol>
</p>



<h2>Special Forms</h2>

<p>Special forms work similarly to function calls, but their arguments
may be evaluated later or not at all. Special forms are also not
beholden to the normal Python variable naming conventions, 'cause
they're special.</p>

<h3 id="special_op">Operators</h3>

<p class="special">(operator expression1 expression2 [...])</p>

<p>Does what you'd expect, (eg: adds, subtracts) the
evaluated values of its expressions</p>

<p>The <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators are unique in
that they will shortcut their evaluation of arguments. The
<code>and</code> operator will return the first false value or the
last value. The <code>or</code> operator will return the first true
value or the last value. <i>Neither operator will evaluate any
expressions after the one returned.</i></p>



<h3 id="special_class">class</h3>

<p class="special">(class namestr (inherit1 [...]) ([(member val) [...]]))</p>

<p>Creates a new type with the given name, inheritence, and
members. At a minimum, the inheritence needs to be
<code>object</code>. The member list may be empty, or may contain
pairs specifying the member name and the value. The member values will
be evaluated in order.</p>

<p>All of the special Python member names apply here, such as
<code>__init__</code>.</p>

<p>The type may be instantiated by calling it like a function.</p>



<h3 id="special_for_each">for-each</h3>

<p class="special">(for-each func sequence)</p>

<p>Applies func (which must be a function taking one argument) to each item
in the sequence. Evaluates to None.</p>



<h3 id="special_generate_while">generate-while</h3>

<p class="special">(generate-while condition expression1 [expression2
...])</p>

<p>Creates a generator. Obtaining the next item evaluates condition.
If the condition is false, the generator ends. If the condition is
true, then the expressions are evaluated in order, with the value of
the last expression becoming the item for that turn.</p>



<h3 id="special_generator">generator</h3>

<p class="special">(generator func sequence [filter_func])</p>

<p>Creates a generator. Obtaining the next item calls func (which must
be a function taking one argument) on the next item in a sequence, and
collects the results into a new list. If the optional filter function
is specified (which must also be a function taking one argument), then
only items which result in the filter returning true will be
processed. The generator ends when no items are left in the
sequence.</p>



<h3 id="special_getf">getf</h3>

<p class="special">(getf var key)</p>

<p>Evaluates to the item of var, by key. Used with lists, tuples, and
dictionaries</p>



<h3 id="special_if">if</h3>

<p class="special">(if condition1 then_body1 [condition2 then_body2
[...]] [else_body])</p>

<p>Evaluates the first condition, and if it is true (in the Pythonic
sense), evaluates the first body. If the first condition evaluates to
false, then any other conditions are checked (if present) until a
matching condition is found, and then its associated body is
evaluated. If no condition could be evaluated to true, then the
optional else body is evaluated.</p>

<p>The value of an <code>if</code> form is the value of its evaluated
body, or None if no body was evaluated (such as when no else body is
specified)</p>



<h3 id="special_lambda">lambda</h3>

<p class="special">(lambda ([var ...]) expression1 [expression2
...])</p>

<p>Creates an anonymous function taking the specified arguments. When
(and if) the function is called, its expressions are evaluated in
order, with the overall value of the call being the value of the last
expression. The expressions are evaluated in order every time the
function is called. The variables cannot be changed via setf.</p>



<h3 id="special_let">let</h3>

<p class="special">(let ([(var val) ...]) expression1 [expression2
...])</p>

<p>Provides a mutable closure for the given expressions, binding
var,val pairs into the namespace first. The variables can be changed
via setf.</p>

<p>Evaluates any values in order, then binds them to their associated
vars. Expressions are then evaluated in order, with the value of the
last expression being the overall value of the form.</p>



<h3 id="special_letrec">letrec</h3>

<p class="special">(letrec ([(var val) ...]) expression1 [expression2
...])</p>

<p>Identical to <code>let</code> with the exception that the variables
are bound into the namespace first, and the values are evaluated
within that namespace (and as such, variables may reference each
other)</p>



<h3 id="special_lc">list-comprehension</h3>

<p class="special">(list-comprehension func sequence
[filter_func])</p>

<p>Calls func (which must be a function taking one argument) on each
item in a sequence, and collects the results into a new list. If the
optional filter function is specified (which must also be a function
taking one argument), then only items which result in the filter
returning true will be collected</p>



<h3 id="special_progn">progn</h3>

<p class="special">(progn expression1 [expression2 ...]])</p>

<p>Evaluates all argument expressions in order. The overall value of a
<code>progn</code> form is the value of its last expression</p>



<h3 id="special_setf">setf</h3>

<p class="special">(setf var val)</p>
<p class="special">(setf var.member val)</p>
<p class="special">(setf (getf obj key) val)</p>

<p>The first form sets a variable to the given value</p>

<p>The second form sets a member of a variable to the given value</p>

<p>The third form sets an item of a variable (such as a list or
dictionary) to the given value</p>



<h3 id="special_while">while</h3>

<p class="special">(while condition expression1 [expression2 ...])</p>

<p>Repeatedly evaluates condition until it is false. After every
evaluation of the condition which was true, all expressions are
evaluated in order.</p>

<p>Overall value is None</p>
