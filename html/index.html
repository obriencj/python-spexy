<title>Spexy, Write Your Python In Lisp</title>

<h1>Spexy</h1>

<p>Spexy is a module which translates a dialect of Lisp into
Python. It can be used as an encoding to transparently have Python
understand our particular subset of Lisp. Spexy does not pollute the
generated output with helper functions or methods, and any output
generated by Spexy does not depend upon Spexy.</p>

<h2>What and Why</h2>

<p>I've heard my grandmother say "there's nothing new under the sun,"
more than a few times. There's already a Scheme interpreter written in
Python, and there's already an S-Expression Python encoding. However,
neither of these work like Spexy.</p>

<p>Spexy can do interesting things like give you a <code>let</code>
form, and a <code>setf</code> to go with it. It gives you a
<code>lambda</code> form with a body of more than one expression
(because there's also a <code>progn</code> form). It doesn't take away
dotted accessors to Python objects. It has variadic forms of
<code>and</code>,<code>or</code>,<code>+</code>,<code>-</code> and a
way to pass those forms as first-class functions</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>The short explanation is that I was just messing around with lambda
one day, and I realized that I could make a <code>let</code>
form. This all exploded out of that.</p>

<p>The long explanation involves me discovering the church of lambda
(in python). I thought it was super keen, but didn't understand it at
first. After staring at it for about a day, the meaning hit me like a
ton of bricks, and I felt euphoric and danced around a little. After
the bouncing and giggling wore off, I decided to try to <a
href="../../lambda/church.py">implement it myself</a>, from
scratch. And when I'd done that, I decided to try and implement some
additional things (which almost gave me a nosebleed, but I
perservered) using only unary lambdas. The very next day, casual
web-browsing led me to a fellow who hacked out a curly-braces encoding
for Python on a whim, and the two ideas smashed together with a
resounding <i>squish</i>. From that tangled, giddy mental landscape
arose the realization that with a few lambas, I could add mutable
closures!</p>

<p>And why in the world would I think about mutable closures? Because
not long before all of this, I'd been messing with another project,
which I call Brine. <a href="../../brine">Brine</a> permits the
pickling of Python's code and cells, and on top of that will allow you
to pickle anonymous and bound functions.</p>

<p>I spent time on this because it makes me happy, and because I
simply can't play World of Warcraft <i>all</i> of the time.</p>
